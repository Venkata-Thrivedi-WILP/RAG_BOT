# Overview
The `/AuthProfile/GetProfileMFAScoring` endpoint is designed to retrieve the authentication assurance level (AAL) for a user's profile. This is done through a POST request that requires specific profile factors to be submitted. The endpoint is secured with bearer token authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the information.
