* `Result` will be an object indicating whether the application is available in the catalog. If true, it will contain no value; if false, it will indicate why the application was not found.
* `Error` will be an object containing an error message text on failure.

### Security Considerations

* Bearer authentication is required for this endpoint.
* The `appKey` query parameter should be validated and sanitized before use.
