# Overview  
The **Clone an existing application** endpoint allows administrators to duplicate an application that has been added to the system. This API is particularly useful when an admin wants to create a new instance of an existing application through the admin portal. The endpoint uses the **POST** method and is accessed at the path **/SaasManage/CloneAnApplication**. Security for this endpoint is managed through bearer token authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can perform the cloning operation.

# Example User Questions  
- How can I clone an existing application using the API?  
- What is the endpoint for duplicating an application?  
- What parameters do I need to provide to clone an app?  
- How do I handle errors when cloning an application?  
- Can I use the application ID to clone an app?  
- What does the response look like when I clone an application?  
- Is there a way to check if the cloning was successful?

# Developer Notes  
- **Required Parameters**:  
  - **Key** (query, Required): This is the name or Unique ID of the application, also known as App key. It can be fetched using a RedRock query. Note that the Key can be either the name or App key of the application but cannot be the Application ID for applications like OAuth or OIDC.
  
- **Request Structure**:  
  - The request must include the Key parameter in the query string.

- **Response Structure**:  
  - The API returns a JSON object containing either the result of the cloning operation or an error message.

- **Error Handling**:  
  - If the application is either a portal or global app or if the template for cloning is not found, an error message will be returned.

- **Security Considerations**:  
  - The endpoint requires bearer token authentication.
