**Overview**
===============

This API securely retrieves the client secret for an OIDC web app. You can use this endpoint by sending a POST request to `/SaasManage/GetOpenIdClientSecret` with the required parameters.

The response includes the client secret in encrypted form as 'e' if encryption is successful, or in plain text as 'p' if encryption fails. The API requires bearer authentication for security.
