# Overview
The **Update Application** API allows users to update various fields related to an application and assign roles for accessing the applications. This endpoint is accessible via a **POST** request at the path **/SaasManage/UpdateApplicationDE**. Only system administrators or users with application management rights can invoke this API. For further guidance, refer to the [documentation](https://identity-developer.cyberark.com/docs/manage-access-to-applications-1#update-an-application). The API requires bearer token authentication for security.
