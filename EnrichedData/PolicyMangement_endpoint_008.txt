**Overview**
------------

Get policy block endpoint allows users to retrieve a specific policy block by providing the policy block name as a query parameter. This endpoint is used for policy management and requires authentication using bearer tokens.

The GET /Policy/GetPolicyBlock method sends a POST request with the policy block name in the query parameter. The security requirement is bearerAuth, which means that an API key or token must be provided in the Authorization header to access this endpoint.

### Required Parameters

* `name` (query, Required): The policy block to get.

### Request/Response Structure

The request body is empty. The response body contains a JSON object with two properties: `Result` and `Error`. The `Result` property contains the policy block details, including risk analysis mapping, authentication profiles, policy modifiers, revision stamp, and radius client list. The `Error` property contains an error message if the policy block does not exist.

### Error Handling

* If the policy block does not exist, an error response is returned with a 404 status code.
* If any other error occurs during processing, an error response is returned with a 500 status code.

### Security Considerations

* Bearer authentication is required for this endpoint. An API key or token must be provided in the Authorization header to access this endpoint.
