# Overview
The **Delete Users** endpoint allows system administrators or users with user management permissions to delete cloud users from the system. The HTTP method used is **POST**, and the endpoint path is **/UserMgmt/RemoveUsers**. It is important to note that users from other directory services will only be removed from the cloud, and the API will fail if any of the specified user IDs belong to the current user. Access to this endpoint requires **bearer authentication**.
