# Overview
The **Start Authentication** endpoint is used to initiate the user's authentication process within the CyberArk Identity system. This endpoint is accessed via a **POST** request to the path **/CDirectoryService/StartAuthentication**. It requires the UUID of the user whose identity is being verified. If the user exists, the response will contain authentication challenges. If the user does not have the necessary attributes to log in, a specific message will be returned. Security and authentication are managed through the CyberArk Identity platform.
