**Overview**
------------

The Set policy endpoint allows users to update and manage policies. This endpoint is used to replace and deprecate SavePolicyBlock2, adding a "rev stamp" functionality to prevent change loss when policies are being edited by multiple users. The endpoint accepts a JSON payload containing the details of the policy being added or updated.

To use this endpoint, you will need to provide authentication using bearerAuth. The path for this endpoint is `/Policy/SavePolicyBlock3`, and it uses the POST method.

### Required Fields

* `policy`: JSON object containing the details of the policy being added or updated.
	+ `Newpolicy` (boolean): boolean set to true if this is a new policy (add)
	+ `Version` (integer): Policy structure version number. 1, at this time.
	+ `Path` (string): path of the policy
	+ `RevStamp` (string): Revision stamp returned from latest call to getPolicyBlock. This is required if Newpolicy is false.
	+ `Description` (string): policy description
* `plinks`: Array of plink objects representing the current plinks file.
	+ Array items: empty object

### Request/Response Structure

The request body should be a JSON payload containing the `policy` and `plinks` fields. The response will contain a JSON object with an `Result` field, which may contain error information on failure.

### Error Handling

* If the `Newpolicy` field is false, the `RevStamp` field is required.
* If any of the fields in the request payload are invalid or missing, the endpoint will return an error response.

### Security Considerations

* The endpoint uses bearer authentication to authenticate requests.
