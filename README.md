## **Question-1**: How to set a policy?

**Answer**:
To set a policy, you should use the POST method to the /Policy/SavePolicyBlock3 endpoint. The request body must be a JSON object containing the policy details and plinks, with the following schema:

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "Newpolicy": boolean,
    "Version": integer,
    "Path": string,
    "RevStamp": string,
    "Description": string
  },
  "plinks": [
    {}
  ]
}
```

You must also include the x-codegen-request-body-name: payload in the metadata.

## **Question-2**: How to delete an app?

**Answer**:
I don't know. The provided context only describes the API endpoints and metadata for deleting a policy block, a tag, an authentication profile, creating a tag with no apps, but does not mention anything about deleting an app.

## **Question-3**: How to get application templates?

**Answer**:
To get application templates, you can use the `/SaasManage/GetTemplatesAndCategories` endpoint. This endpoint accepts a POST request and requires authentication via bearer token.

The request body is not specified in the metadata, but it's mentioned that it follows the schema properties defined in the UPRestCreateTagWithNoApp response, which includes `appkey` and `tagnames`. However, since the purpose of this endpoint is to get application templates, these fields are likely not relevant.

The most straightforward way to get the answer is by checking the sample response JSON:

```json
{
  "Result": {
    // Application template properties (e.g., Category, DisplayName, AppType, etc.)
  },
  "Error": {}
}
```

You can send a POST request to the `/SaasManage/GetTemplatesAndCategories` endpoint with an empty request body and authenticate yourself via bearer token. The response will contain a list of application templates in the `Result` property.

Alternatively, you could check the metadata for any specific parameters or requirements that might be necessary for this endpoint.

## **Question-4**: What is request body to create a tag?

**Answer**:
The request body to create a tag consists of a JSON object with a single required field, "tagname", which is the name of the tag. The schema for the request body has the following properties:

- Content Type: application/json
- Schema Properties:
  - tagname (string): tag name
  - Required fields: tagname

Example request JSON:
```json
{
  "tagname": "string_value"
}
```
This indicates that the request body must be a JSON object with a single property, "tagname", which has a string value.

## **Question-5**: What is request body to set a policy? explain with example

**Answer**:
The request body to set a policy for the "/Policy/SavePolicyBlock3" endpoint is a JSON object that contains two required fields:

1. "policy": This field is an object that contains the details of the policy being added or updated. The object has several nested properties:
   * "Newpolicy": A boolean indicating whether this is a new policy (add) or an update.
   * "Version": An integer representing the policy structure version number, currently set to 1.
   * "Path": A string representing the path of the policy.
   * "RevStamp": A string representing the revision stamp returned from the latest call to getPolicyBlock. This field is required if "Newpolicy" is false.
   * "Description": A string representing the policy description.

2. "plinks": This field is an array of plink objects representing the current plinks file. The array has a single item, which is also an object containing the details of the plink.

Example:

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "Newpolicy": true,
    "Version": 0,
    "Path": "/policies/12345",
    "RevStamp": "",
    "Description": "This is a new policy"
  },
  "plinks": [
    {
      // plink details
    }
  ]
}
```

Alternatively, if this is an update (Newpolicy = false), the request body would include the RevStamp:

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "Newpolicy": false,
    "Version": 0,
    "Path": "/policies/12345",
    "RevStamp": "abcde12345678901234567890123456789012",
    "Description": "This is an updated policy"
  },
  "plinks": [
    {
      // plink details
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: The actual values for the fields should be replaced with the appropriate data.
