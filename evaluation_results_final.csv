2,"Explain the complete authentication flow implemented through the StartAuthentication and SendIdentityVerification endpoints, including the sequence of operations and parameter dependencies.","The authentication flow implemented through these endpoints follows a challenge-response pattern: 1) Flow Initiation: The process begins with /CDirectoryService/StartAuthentication where the client provides the user's UUID. If the user exists, the server creates an authentication session and returns available challenges based on the user's configured authentication methods. 2) Session Continuation: The client then uses /CDirectoryService/SendIdentityVerification with the SessionId and MechanismId received from StartAuthentication. This endpoint advances the authentication process based on the 'action' parameter, which can be: 'startoob' (starts out-of-band authentication), 'poll' (checks status of pending authentication), or 'answer' (submits user's response to a challenge). 3) Mechanism Coordination: Different authentication mechanisms (SMS, Email, OATH, Phone call, Mobile Authenticator) are coordinated through the MechanismId parameter, allowing the system to properly route and process the specific authentication method. 4) Parameter Dependencies: Each subsequent call to SendIdentityVerification depends on the previous responses, creating a stateful authentication flow where the SessionId links all interactions in a single authentication attempt. 5) Completion: The authentication flow continues with multiple SendIdentityVerification calls until either successful authentication is achieved or the maximum attempt threshold is reached. This implementation allows for flexible multi-factor authentication while maintaining security through isolated, stateful sessions and support for various authentication mechanisms.",Basic endpoint recall,hard,Simple_Ensemble_Retriever,"## Authentication Flow Using StartAuthentication and SendIdentityVerification Endpoints

The authentication process in CyberArk Identity involves two main endpoints: **Start Authentication** and **Send Identity Verification**. Below is a detailed explanation of the flow, including the sequence of operations and parameter dependencies.

### 1. Start Authentication

- **Endpoint:** `/CDirectoryService/StartAuthentication`
- **HTTP Method:** POST

#### Operation:
1. **Initiate Authentication:**
   - A client application sends a POST request to the **Start Authentication** endpoint.
   - The request must include the **UUID** of the user whose identity is being verified.

#### Response:
- If the user exists:
  - The response will contain authentication challenges that the user must complete.
- If the user does not have the necessary attributes to log in:
  - A specific message will be returned indicating the issue.

### 2. Send Identity Verification

- **Endpoint:** `/CDirectoryService/SendIdentityVerification`
- **HTTP Method:** POST

#### Operation:
1. **Verify Identity:**
   - After successfully creating a user authentication session with the **Start Authentication** API, the client application invokes the **Send Identity Verification** API.
   - This API requires two parameters from the previous step:
     - **SessionId**: Returned from the **Start Authentication** response.
     - **MechanismId**: Also returned from the **Start Authentication** response.
   - The request can include various actions such as starting an out-of-band mechanism, advancing an in-band mechanism, or polling for user responses.

#### Request Body:
- The request body must be in JSON format and include the following properties:
  - **Type** (string): Type of the entity (e.g., Application).
  - **Key** (string): Unique ID of the entity.
  - **Url** (string): Actual URL of the application (if applicable).
  - **BypassLoginMFA** (boolean): Indicates if the application can bypass MFA (default is false).
  - **Row** (string): Details about user-accessible applications.

#### Response:
- The response will depend on the actions taken and the results of the identity verification process.

### Summary of Parameter Dependencies
- The **Start Authentication** endpoint requires the **UUID** of the user.
- The **Send Identity Verification** endpoint requires:
  - **SessionId** and **MechanismId** obtained from the **Start Authentication** response.

   - **MechanismId (string):** The mechanism ID provided in the response from the **StartAuthentication** endpoint.
   - **SessionId (string):** The ID of the authentication session created during the **StartAuthentication** call.
   - **TenantId (string):** The tenant ID where the user is authenticating, consistent with the tenant used in the **StartAuthentication**.

#### Request Body Example:
```json
{
  ""Action"": ""string_value"",
  ""Answer"": ""string_value"",
  ""MechanismId"": ""string_value"",
  ""SessionId"": ""string_value"",
  ""TenantId"": ""string_value""
}
```

#### Response:
- The response will indicate whether the API request was successful and provide the result from the Identity Cloud.

### Summary of Parameter Dependencies
- The **SendIdentityVerification** endpoint relies on the **SessionId** and **MechanismId** obtained from the response of the **StartAuthentication** endpoint.
- The **TenantId** must match the tenant used in the **StartAuthentication** request to ensure consistency in the authentication process.

- **Algorithm**: 
  - This parameter specifies the algorithm used for TOTP verification code generation. The default algorithm is SHA1. If you choose a different algorithm, ensure that it is supported by your TOTP application.

- **Digits**: 
  - This defines the number of digits in the verification code. The typical values are 6 or 8 digits. A higher number of digits can increase security but may also affect usability.

- **Period**: 
  - The documentation does not specify a `period` parameter, so I don't have that specific information in the documentation I can access. Generally, the period defines how often a new TOTP code is generated (e.g., every 30 seconds).

### Summary
- Not providing `totpSecret` clears the existing TOTP secret.
- The `algorithm` can be set to different values, with SHA1 as the default.
- The `digits` parameter allows you to specify the length of the verification code.

5,"When using /UPRest/SaveTotpSeedForSecuredPassword, what happens if you don't provide a value for the totpSecret parameter, and what are the implications of the different algorithm, period, and digits parameters?","If you don't provide a value for the totpSecret parameter when calling /UPRest/SaveTotpSeedForSecuredPassword, the system clears the existing TOTP secret for the secured password, effectively disabling TOTP functionality for that account. The algorithm parameter (default: SHA1) specifies the cryptographic algorithm used for generating verification codes, with SHA1 being the most widely compatible but SHA256 or SHA512 offering increased security. The period parameter (default: 30 seconds) defines the verification code validity timeframe - shorter periods increase security but may cause user friction, while longer periods improve usability at the cost of security. The digits parameter determines the number of digits in the verification code (typically 6), affecting its complexity and security - more digits increase the code's resistance to brute force attacks but may reduce usability. These parameters collectively define the TOTP configuration's security properties and compatibility with authenticator applications, requiring careful consideration of the security-usability tradeoff when configuring them.",Request parameter identification,hard,BERT_Based_Re-Rank,"### Response to Your Question

When using the `/UPRest/SaveTotpSeedForSecuredPassword` endpoint, if you do not provide a value for the `totpSecret` parameter, the system will clear the existing secret for the secured password. This means that the TOTP functionality will no longer be available for that secured password.

#### Implications of Parameters

1. **Algorithm**:
   - This parameter specifies the algorithm used for TOTP verification code generation. The default algorithm is SHA1. If you choose a different algorithm, it may affect how the TOTP codes are generated and validated.

2. **Period**:
   - The period defines the validity duration of the verification code. Typically, TOTP codes are valid for a short time (e.g., 30 seconds). If you set a different period, it will determine how often new codes are generated and how long they remain valid.

3. **Digits**:
   - This parameter defines the number of digits in the verification code. Commonly, TOTP codes are 6 digits long, but you can specify a different number. A higher number of digits may enhance security but could also make it more cumbersome for users to enter the code.

### Summary
- Not providing `totpSecret` clears the existing TOTP secret.
- The `algorithm`, `period`, and `digits` parameters can be customized, affecting the TOTP generation and validation process.","{'accuracy': 5, 'completeness': 4, 'conciseness': 4, 'clarity_readability': 5, 'adherence_to_instructions': 5, 'relevance_to_expected_answer': 5}","{'accuracy_notes': 'The generated answer accurately reflects the consequences of not providing a value for the totpSecret parameter and correctly describes the implications of the algorithm, period, and digits parameters.', 'completeness_notes': 'While the answer covers most essential points, it could provide more detail on the security-usability tradeoff mentioned in the reference answer.', 'conciseness_notes': 'The answer is generally concise, but there are minor areas where it could be tightened further.', 'clarity_readability_notes': 'The structure and language used in the answer are clear and well-organized, making it easy to read.', 'adherence_to_instructions_notes': 'The answer follows the specified format and does not deviate from the instructions.', 'relevance_to_expected_answer_notes': 'The generated answer is highly relevant and closely matches the intent and scope of the reference answer.', 'overall_summary': 'Overall, the generated answer is strong, with high accuracy and clarity.

### Structure Analysis

1. **Newpolicy (boolean)**:
   - This property indicates whether the policy being added or updated is new. If set to `true`, it signifies that a new policy is being created. If `false`, it indicates an update to an existing policy, which requires the `RevStamp` to ensure that the update is based on the latest version of the policy.

2. **Version (integer)**:
   - The `Version` property specifies the version number of the policy structure. Currently, it is set to `1`. This allows for future enhancements and changes to the policy structure while maintaining backward compatibility. It helps in tracking the evolution of policy definitions over time.

3. **Path (string)**:
   - The `Path` property defines the location or identifier of the policy within the system. This is essential for locating the specific policy that is being added or updated.

4. **RevStamp (string)**:
   - The `RevStamp` is a critical component for concurrency control. It is required when updating an existing policy (i.e., when `Newpolicy` is `false`). The `RevStamp` ensures that the update is based on the most recent version of the policy, preventing loss of changes that may occur if multiple users are editing the same policy simultaneously. If a user attempts to update a policy with an outdated `RevStamp`, the system can reject the request, thereby maintaining data integrity.

5. **Description (string)**:
   - The `Description` property provides additional context about the policy. While it does not directly contribute to concurrency control or versioning, it enhances the clarity and documentation of the policy being managed.

### Conclusion

The structure of the request body for the `/Policy/SavePolicyBlock3` endpoint effectively supports both concurrency control and policy versioning through the use of the `Newpolicy` and `RevStamp` properties. The `RevStamp` ensures that updates are made based on the latest policy version, while the `Version` property allows for tracking and managing changes to the policy structure over time.

Here's an analysis of how this is achieved:

## Request Body Structure

The request body consists of two main components:

1. **policy** (object)
2. **plinks** (array)

### 1. Policy Object

The `policy` object contains several key properties that enable concurrency control and versioning:

- **Newpolicy (boolean)**: 
  - This flag indicates whether the policy being submitted is new or an update to an existing policy. If set to `true`, it signifies that a new policy is being created. If `false`, it indicates an update, which is crucial for managing existing policies.

- **Version (integer)**: 
  - This property represents the version number of the policy structure. By maintaining a version number, the API can track changes over time and ensure that updates are applied correctly. This is essential for versioning as it allows the system to differentiate between different iterations of the policy.

- **RevStamp (string)**: 
  - The revision stamp is a critical component for concurrency control. It is required when `Newpolicy` is `false`, meaning that if a user attempts to update an existing policy, they must provide the latest revision stamp obtained from a previous call to `getPolicyBlock`. This mechanism helps prevent lost updates by ensuring that the policy is only modified if the revision stamp matches the current state of the policy. If another user has updated the policy since the last retrieval, the revision stamp will not match, and the update will be rejected, thus preventing conflicting changes.

- **Path (string)**: 
  - This specifies the location of the policy, which is necessary for identifying which policy is being updated or created.

- **Description (string)**: 
  - This provides context about the policy, which can be useful for documentation and understanding the purpose of the policy.

### 2. Plinks Array

- **plinks (array)**: 
  - This array contains plink objects that represent the current plinks file. While the specific structure of the plink objects is not detailed in the provided context, having an array allows for the inclusion of multiple links or references associated with the policy. This flexibility can be important for managing complex policies that may involve multiple components.

## Summary

The combination of these parameters in the request body schema allows for:

- **Concurrency Control**: The use of the `RevStamp` ensures that updates are only applied if the policy has not been changed by another user since it was last retrieved. This prevents overwriting changes made by others.

- **Policy Versioning**: The `Version` property allows the API to track different versions of the policy, enabling users to manage and reference specific iterations of the policy over time.

Overall, this structured approach ensures that the API can handle multiple users editing policies simultaneously while maintaining the integrity and history of policy changes.","{'accuracy': 5, 'completeness': 5, 'conciseness': 4, 'clarity_readability': 4, 'adherence_to_instructions': 5, 'relevance_to_expected_answer': 5}","{'accuracy_notes': 'The generated answer accurately reflects the key components of the request body schema and their roles in concurrency control and policy versioning, matching the reference answer perfectly.', 'completeness_notes': 'All essential points from the reference answer are covered, including the roles of each property in the schema.', 'conciseness_notes': 'The answer is mostly concise, but could be slightly tighter in some explanations without losing clarity.', 'clarity_readability_notes': 'The structure is generally clear and well-organized, though some sections could be streamlined for better readability.', 'adherence_to_instructions_notes': 'The generated answer follows the instructions perfectly, maintaining the required format and content focus.', 'relevance_to_expected_answer_notes': 'The answer is fully relevant, addressing the same core question and maintaining the intent and scope of the reference answer.', 'overall_summary': 'Overall, the generated answer is strong, accurately covering the necessary details with minor room for improvement in conciseness and clarity.

### Structure Explanation

1. **Newpolicy (boolean)**:
   - This field indicates whether the policy being added or updated is new. If set to `true`, it signifies that a new policy is being created. If `false`, it indicates an update to an existing policy.

2. **Version (integer)**:
   - This field specifies the version number of the policy structure. Currently, it is set to `1`, which helps in maintaining version control of the policy. This is crucial for ensuring that updates are applied correctly and that the system can manage different versions of policies.

5. **Description (string)**:
   - This field provides a description of the policy, which can be useful for documentation and understanding the purpose of the policy.

### Concurrency Control and Policy Versioning

- **Concurrency Control**:
  - The use of the `RevStamp` allows the system to manage concurrent edits effectively. When multiple users attempt to update the same policy, the RevStamp ensures that only the most recent version of the policy is modified. If a user tries to update a policy with an outdated RevStamp, the system can reject the request, thereby preventing overwriting changes made by others.

- **Policy Versioning**:
  - The `Version` field facilitates version control by allowing the system to track changes over time. This is essential for maintaining a history of policy updates and ensuring that users can revert to previous versions if necessary.

11,"What fields are included in the Result object of a /SaasManage/ImportAppFromTemplate response, and how does the structure support batch processing with detailed error reporting?","The Result object of a /SaasManage/ImportAppFromTemplate response contains a comprehensive structure supporting batch processing with detailed error reporting. At the top level, it includes standard fields like 'success' (overall operation status), 'Message' (general error information), 'ErrorID', 'ErrorCode', 'IsSoftError' (indicates UI warnings vs. true errors), and 'InnerExceptions'. The key to batch processing support is the 'Result' sub-field which contains an array where each element represents an individual application import attempt with the following properties: 1) '_RowKey': The generated unique ID for successfully created applications, 2) 'ID': The template name that was attempted to be imported, 3) 'success': Boolean indicating if that specific template was imported successfully, and 4) 'Exception': Containing detailed error information when the specific import failed. This structure allows clients to process multiple application templates in a single request and receive granular success/failure information for each one, enabling sophisticated error handling and retry logic. For example, if a batch of 10 templates is submitted and 3 fail, the client can determine exactly which ones failed and why, while still leveraging the 7 successful imports without needing to resubmit those. This design pattern is particularly valuable for large-scale deployments where partial success is acceptable and detailed error reporting is necessary for operational troubleshooting.",Response schema comprehension,hard,BERT_Based_Re-Rank,"### Response Structure for `/SaasManage/ImportAppFromTemplate`

The `Result` object in the response from the `/SaasManage/ImportAppFromTemplate` endpoint includes the following fields:

- **ErrorID** (string): 
  - Description: Error ID if any error is received from the API. By default, it is 'null'.

- **ErrorCode** (string): 
  - Description: Error code if any error is received from the API. By default, it is 'null'.

- **Exception** (string): 
  - Description: Exception message if any exception is received from the API. By default, it is 'null'.

- **MessageID** (string): 
  - Description: Message Id for failure response. By default, it is 'null'.

- **Result** (array): 
  - Description: An array containing the results of the import operation.
  - **Array items**:
    - **_RowKey** (string): 
      - Description: The name or Unique ID of the application, also known as App key. For example, `1c585369-b077-44f8-972f-78d0ffd9ac87`.

### Batch Processing and Error Reporting

The structure supports batch processing by allowing multiple results to be returned in the `Result` array. Each item in the array can represent the outcome of an individual application import attempt, which facilitates detailed error reporting. If there are errors during the import process, the corresponding `ErrorID`, `ErrorCode`, and `Exception` fields provide specific information about what went wrong, enabling developers to troubleshoot issues effectively.

This design allows for comprehensive feedback on the import operation, making it easier to identify and resolve errors for each application being processed in the batch.","{'accuracy': 4, 'completeness': 4, 'conciseness': 4, 'clarity_readability': 4, 'adherence_to_instructions': 5, 'relevance_to_expected_answer': 4}","{'accuracy_notes': ""The generated answer is mostly accurate but lacks some specific details about the 'IsSoftError' field and the implications of the structure for batch processing."", 'completeness_notes': ""The answer covers most essential points but omits the 'IsSoftError' field and the detailed explanation of how the structure supports batch processing."", 'conciseness_notes': 'The answer is generally concise but could be slightly tighter in some explanations.', 'clarity_readability_notes': 'The structure is clear and well-organized, making it easy to read, though some sections could be more succinct.', 'adherence_to_instructions_notes': 'The generated answer follows the formatting and structure instructions perfectly.', 'relevance_to_expected_answer_notes': 'The answer is relevant and closely matches the intent of the reference answer, but it misses some nuances.', 'overall_summary': 'The generated answer provides a solid overview of the Result object and its fields, effectively addressing the question.

In contrast, /UserMgmt/SetCloudLock uses a simpler boolean 'lockUser' parameter that toggles between locked and unlocked states. 2) Granularity: SetUserState offers fine-grained control by allowing multiple state flags to be set independently, creating composite states that represent complex access conditions. SetCloudLock provides only binary control (locked/unlocked) with no intermediate states. 3) Use Cases: SetUserState is better suited for complex security policies requiring nuanced access control, such as compliance scenarios where users might need to be expired but not locked, or disabled but still able to complete certain actions. SetCloudLock is designed for simpler administrative actions where binary enable/disable functionality is sufficient. The implications of these different approaches include: 1) Implementation Complexity: Systems integrating with these APIs need different state management logic - more complex state tracking for SetUserState versus simpler boolean flags for SetCloudLock. 2) State Transition Management: With SetUserState, applications must carefully manage transitions between composite states, while SetCloudLock transitions are straightforward. 3) Audit and Compliance: SetUserState provides more detailed information about why a user's access is restricted, which can be valuable for audit trails and compliance reporting. 4) Error Handling: The more complex state model of SetUserState introduces more potential for errors in state management logic compared to the simpler SetCloudLock model.

### Overview of Each Endpoint

#### 1. `/CDirectoryService/SetUserState`
- **Functionality**: This endpoint allows authorized users to manage the state of Cloud Directory accounts. It can lock, disable, or set an account to expired.
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Access**: Only system administrators and users with user management permissions can invoke this API.
- **State Options**: 
  - `None`: Reenables a locked account.
  - `Locked`: Locks the account.
  - `Disabled`: Disables the account.
  - `Expired`: Sets the account to expired.
- **Use Case**: Useful for managing user accounts based on security policies, such as locking accounts after failed login attempts or disabling accounts that are no longer in use.

#### 2. `/UserMgmt/SetCloudLock`
- **Functionality**: This endpoint is specifically designed to lock or unlock a user account within the system.
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Access**: Intended for system administrators, users with user management rights, or the user themselves.
- **State Management**: Primarily focuses on locking and unlocking user accounts.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for immediate user account control, such as locking an account due to suspicious activity or unlocking it when access is restored.

### Key Differences

- **Scope of Functionality**:
  - `/CDirectoryService/SetUserState` provides a broader range of state management options (Locked, Disabled, Expired) compared to `/UserMgmt/SetCloudLock`, which focuses solely on locking and unlocking accounts.
  
- **State Management Approach**:
  - The `/CDirectoryService/SetUserState` endpoint allows for more nuanced control over user states, enabling administrators to set accounts to expired or disabled, which may be necessary for compliance or security protocols.
  - The `/UserMgmt/SetCloudLock` endpoint is more straightforward, focusing on immediate actions (lock/unlock) without the additional states.

### Implications of Different State Management Approaches

- **Security and Compliance**: The ability to set accounts to expired or disabled in `/CDirectoryService/SetUserState` can help organizations comply with security policies that require deactivation of accounts after a certain period or under specific conditions.
  
- **User Experience**: The `/UserMgmt/SetCloudLock` endpoint allows users or administrators to quickly respond to security incidents by locking accounts, which can enhance the overall security posture of the organization.

- **Administrative Control**: The broader functionality of `/CDirectoryService/SetUserState` may require more careful management and understanding of user states, while `/UserMgmt/SetCloudLock` offers a simpler interface for immediate user account control.

### Conclusion

Both endpoints serve important roles in user account management within CyberArk Identity. The choice between them depends on the specific needs of the organization regarding user state management and security protocols.","{'accuracy': 4, 'completeness': 4, 'conciseness': 4, 'clarity_readability': 4, 'adherence_to_instructions': 5, 'relevance_to_expected_answer': 5}","{'accuracy_notes': 'The generated answer is mostly accurate but lacks some specific details about the state representation and granularity that were highlighted in the reference answer.', 'completeness_notes': 'The answer covers most key points but omits some nuances regarding the implications of the different state management approaches.', 'conciseness_notes': 'The answer is generally concise, but some sections could be tightened further to enhance clarity.', 'clarity_readability_notes': 'The structure is clear and well-organized, but a few sentences could be phrased more effectively for better readability.', 'adherence_to_instructions_notes': 'The generated answer follows the specified format and instructions perfectly.', 'relevance_to_expected_answer_notes': 'The answer is highly relevant and addresses the core question effectively, matching the intent and scope of the reference answer.', 'overall_summary': 'Overall, the generated answer is strong, with good accuracy and relevance.

### Step 1: Create a New User
1. **Endpoint:** Use the Create User API.
2. **Path:** `/CDirectoryService/CreateUser`
3. **Method:** `POST`
4. **Authentication:** Bearer authentication is required.

#### Request Body
You need to provide a JSON request body with the following properties:
```json
{
  ""InEverybodyRole"": true,  // Optional, default is true
  ""SendSmsInvite"": false,    // Optional, default is false
  ""InSysAdminRole"": false,   // Optional, default is false
  ""Description"": ""string""     // Optional, default is null
}
```

### Step 2: Verify User Creation
- After sending the request to create a user, check the response to confirm that the user has been successfully created.

### Step 3: (Optional) Send Invites
- If you want to send an SMS or email invite to the user, ensure that the `SendSmsInvite` property is set to `true` in the request body.

### Additional Information
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions (system administrator or user management rights) to create a user.
- You can also check if a user already exists by using the **Get Users Details** API before creating a new user.

### `/UserMgmt/IsUserLockedOutByPolicy`
- **Purpose:** This endpoint checks if a user is locked out due to policy restrictions, specifically regarding their ability to answer Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) challenges.
- **Method:** POST
- **Path:** `/UserMgmt/IsUserLockedOutByPolicy`
- **Parameters:**
  - `user` (query, Required): The name or unique ID of the user to test. An empty string can be passed to test the currently logged-in user.
- **Response:** Returns `True` if the user is locked out (unable to answer MFA challenges) and `False` otherwise.
- **Access:** Only system administrators, users with user management rights, or the user themselves can invoke this API.

### `/UserMgmt/IsUserCloudLocked`
- **Purpose:** This endpoint determines if a specific user account is locked in the cloud system.
- **Method:** POST
- **Path:** `/UserMgmt/IsUserCloudLocked`
- **Parameters:**
  - `user` (query, Required): The unique ID of the user.
- **Response:** Provides the lock status of the user account in the cloud.
- **Access:** Similar to the previous endpoint, only system administrators, users with user management rights, or the user themselves can invoke this API.

### Complementary Functionality
- **User Lockout vs. User Lock Status:** 
  - The `/UserMgmt/IsUserLockedOutByPolicy` endpoint focuses on whether a user can authenticate based on policy (MFA challenges), while the `/UserMgmt/IsUserCloudLocked` endpoint checks if the user account itself is locked.
  
- **Use Cases:**
  - An administrator might first check if a user is locked out due to policy restrictions (MFA) using the first endpoint. If the user is not locked out but still cannot access their account, the administrator can then check the account lock status using the second endpoint to determine if the account is locked in the cloud.

By utilizing both endpoints, administrators can effectively manage user access and troubleshoot authentication issues comprehensively.","{'accuracy': 5, 'completeness': 5, 'conciseness': 4, 'clarity_readability': 5, 'adherence_to_instructions': 5, 'relevance_to_expected_answer': 5}","{'accuracy_notes': 'The generated answer accurately reflects the functionality of both endpoints without any factual errors.', 'completeness_notes': 'All essential points from the reference answer are covered, including the purposes, methods, parameters, and responses of both endpoints.', 'conciseness_notes': 'The answer is mostly concise, but the detailed breakdown of each endpoint could be slightly more succinct.', 'clarity_readability_notes': 'The structure is clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand.', 'adherence_to_instructions_notes': 'The answer follows the specified format and does not deviate from the instructions.', 'relevance_to_expected_answer_notes': 'The generated answer is fully relevant and matches the intent and scope of the reference answer.', 'overall_summary': 'The generated answer is strong overall, providing accurate, complete, and clear information about the endpoints.
